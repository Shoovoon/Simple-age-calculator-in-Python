#Finding correct age:
from datetime import date
current_year = date.today().year

birth_year = input("What\'s your Birth year? ")



age = (current_year - int(birth_year))

#print(f"So, you are {age} year\'s old.")
print(age)

#if i dont convert the birth_year to int, it will cause type error (TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'int' and 'str'
) as birthyear input saves as a str.
